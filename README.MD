Numac Script by MK Design
Author: Matt Knouff

This is a simple BASH script for changing the MAC address of a device.
This was written to solve a problem of my apartment complex's wifi 
service blocking my MAC address occasionally if I downloaded a large 
file, regardless of whether it was a torrent, ftp, http or other 
protocol.

This was written specifically for PCBSD 9.2 but should work with 
possible minor tweaking necessary on other systems.

Feel free to modify and improve the code.
